			<p>Since 1938, planning for a new aviation organization that would provide support for the military serving in the US homeland during a future war had been ongoing among a group of visionary aviators and civic leaders.  They theorized on the uses of general aviation to support training and mobilization of an expanding Army Air Corps, and to assist in Civil Defense.  Just days before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) was officially organized to provide trained civilian aviators and other personnel to assist in the war effort.  By war’s end, CAP had flown more than mission hours, had provided needed training to young men and women entering the armed forces, conducted search and rescue missions, carried more than 1,750 tons of cargo plus hundreds of military passengers…and were credited with sinking two enemy submarines.  

</p>
            <p>Following World War II, CAP and its missions were chartered to be “solely of a benevolent character” and became the official civilian auxiliary to the newly formed US Air Force.  CAP was given three Congressionally-mandated missions: Aerospace Education, Cadet Programs, and Emergency Services.</p>
			
			<p>Today, CAP has a presence in all 50 states and two territories, with nearly 60,000 volunteer members who daily perform missions for America.  For more information on the Civil Air Patrol see <a href="www.gocivilairpatrol.com" target="_blank"> www.gocivilairpatrol.com</a></p>

In over 1,000 local squadrons, CAP Cadets learn how to make the CAP Core Values of Integrity, Service, Excellence, and Respect a central part of their lives.  CAP Cadets are given opportunities to lead others with adult supervision and mentoring.  While later military service is not an obligation for membership, CAP Cadets are well represented at all four service academies and in college ROTC detachments across the country.  “Today’s Cadets…tomorrow’s aerospace leaders.”
